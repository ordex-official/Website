<h1>Introduction</h1>

We are committed to delivering reliable, open tools that foster trust and transparency, this project is on eary stage and currently  **Under Development** and aims to provide a transparent, user-friendly suite of tools designed to enhance the experience of the **Solana Ecosystem** ‚Äî including developers, investors, and enthusiasts alike. We started with an initial focus on reclaim rent tool.
 
This is just the beginning of our journey to build a comprehensive platform that empowers the community to stay safe and informed...
    
<h3>‚ú® Features:</h3>

- **‚ôªÔ∏è Reclaim Rent**

    Check and close up to 50 empty token accounts at once to reclaim locked SOL and tidy your wallet. This fast tool scans your wallet for empty Associated Token Accounts (ATAs) without requiring wallet connection or any fees for checking. Closing accounts incurs the lowest fees in the ecosystem, with no hidden charges, supporting ongoing project development.

    - Quickly find empty token accounts across your wallet
    - Close multiple accounts at once to reclaim rent.


- **üî• LP & Token Burner** *( Coming Soon... )*

    Burn liquidity pool (LP) tokens and SPL tokens to keep your wallet clean, secure, and clutter-free. LP burns are recorded on a public showcase page with detailed information including the token pair, amount burned, date, and transaction link. This provides full transparency for both developers and communities. <strong>Burning also closes the token account, reclaiming rent and fully cleaning up your wallet.</strong>

    - Burn tokens and close their accounts in a single transaction. 
    - Get rid of unsellable tokens that have no value.

<h2>ü™ô Associated Token Accounts</h2>

<p>On the Solana blockchain, tokens aren‚Äôt held directly by wallet addresses. Instead, each token is stored in a separate account called an <strong>Associated Token Account (ATA)</strong>, which is uniquely linked to both the wallet and the token. To remain active on the network, each token account must hold a small amount of solana as <strong>account rent</strong> to stay active on the network ‚Äî this prevents the account from being deleted over time.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>ATA ~ 0.002 SOL</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Each token account holds one token type and stays open when its balance reaches zero. <br> Closing it returns the locked solana to wallet.</p>

<h4>üí∏ Who pays for the rent !? </h4>
When buying tokens, you pay rent if the token account does not exist. For tokens sent to you such as airdrops, spam tokens, or transfers, the sender typically covers the one-time rent to create your token account. After that, no additional rent is required to receive tokens.

Token accounts become empty when you transfer or sell all supply of a specific token held in that account. However, these accounts don‚Äôt close automatically. They remain open so they can receive tokens again without requiring you to pay rent each time the account is recreated. This design saves users from repeatedly paying the rent fee and makes receiving tokens easier and more efficient.
